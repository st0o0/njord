## Project

njord — Open-Meteo weather API → MQTT bridge for Home Assistant. A .NET service
(Docker container) on Akka.NET + Akka.Streams: polls the Open-Meteo API for
multiple weather models per location, computes a consensus forecast, and publishes
Home Assistant entities via MQTT Discovery (Mosquitto broker on the HA host).

### Architecture guardrails

- **Three zones that only meet in the domain model:** Ingest (Open-Meteo client,
  DTOs, parsing) → Domain (`ModelForecast`, consensus) → Egress (HA entity
  definitions, topic builder, discovery payloads). Ingest and Egress never
  reference each other.
- **Streams for data flow, actors for lifecycle.** The poll pipeline is
  Akka.Streams (tick → fan-out → throttle → HTTP → aggregate → consensus → MQTT).
  Actors own connection management and the HA birth-message subscription.
- **Discovery and telemetry are separate flows.** Discovery (retained config
  payloads) is lifecycle-driven: startup, HA birth on `homeassistant/status`,
  config change. Telemetry (state topics) is tick-driven.
- **The entity set is static, derived from config** (locations × models ×
  parameters × horizons) — never from what the API happens to return. A missing
  value is an `unavailable` state, not a missing entity.
- **Never `Zip` model sub-streams for consensus.** Aggregate per poll cycle
  (cycle id = tick timestamp) with timeout and quorum — consensus from whatever
  arrived, plus `models_used`/spread diagnostics.
- **`TimeProvider` everywhere**, never `DateTime.Now`/`UtcNow` directly.

### Decisions (2026-07-11 — migrate into `openspec/specs/` as changes land)

- Multiple locations from v1; topics and devices carry a location level.
- Open-Meteo free tier (non-commercial) is the assumed plan: the request budget
  defaults to its soft limits (300k/month, 600/min) with an optional
  `BudgetOverride` for self-throttling. Startup validates projected usage
  against 80 % of the resolved monthly budget. Commercial use would need the
  paid tier (out of scope).
- Poll interval and request budget are config values (default 60 min). Any change
  that adds or alters polling needs a budget estimate against the free-tier soft
  limits (300k/month, 10k/day) — and politeness toward a free service.
- Feels-like comes from the API (`apparent_temperature` per model) — no own
  Steadman computation.
- **Consensus is deferred (pivot 2026-07-12):** per-model data goes to HA 1:1
  first; consensus may later happen in HA (helpers) or return as a njord
  change (it would join the topic scheme as pseudo-model `consensus`).
- HA device cut: per location, one device per weather model, **enabled by
  default** (they are the product while no consensus device exists).
- Entity grid per model device: one sensor per (parameter, horizon) — horizons
  configurable, default +3/+6/+12/+24/+48/+72 h → 54 sensors/device, 432 per
  location at the 8-model default. No JSON series attribute, no `state_class`
  (forecasts are not measurements). Recommend a `recorder:` exclude for
  `sensor.njord_*` in HA docs/snippets.
- MQTT egress: device-based discovery (one retained config per device,
  `homeassistant/device/<id>/config`, verified 2026-07-12), one retained
  state JSON per device per cycle, availability via LWT on `njord/status` +
  per-component `availability_template` + `expire_after` (2× poll interval).
  MQTTnet sits behind the `IMqttPublisher` seam; the connection actor owns
  lifecycle, HA birth handling, and tombstoning of stale retained configs.

## Build & test

All commands run from `src/` (where `global.json` lives):

```powershell
dotnet build Njord.slnx
dotnet run --project Njord.Tests/Njord.Tests.csproj              # all tests
dotnet run --project Njord.Tests/Njord.Tests.csproj -- -class "<FullyQualifiedName>"
```

Tests are xUnit v3 on Microsoft.Testing.Platform — `dotnet run`, **not** `dotnet test`.

Run the service itself from `src/Njord/` (`dotnet run`) — the host's content
root must contain `appsettings.json`. `dotnet slopwatch` runs from the repo
root (baseline in `.slopwatch/`).

## Open-Meteo API (verified 2026-07-11 via live probes)

- Endpoint `GET https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=&longitude=` —
  **no API key, no auth header**. Free tier is non-commercial; soft limits
  600/min, 5k/h, 10k/day, 300k/month. Calls are weighted: >10 hourly variables
  or >2 weeks of data count fractionally as multiple calls (njord requests
  exactly 9 variables × 4 days = weight 1.0).
- Single-model requests (`&models=icon_d2`) return flat arrays under `hourly`
  with **unsuffixed** variable names + an `hourly_units` object; multi-model
  requests suffix every variable with the model id.
- Wind defaults to km/h — always send `wind_speed_unit=ms`. Times default to
  naive ISO strings — always send `timeformat=unixtime` (epoch seconds).
- Values beyond a model's horizon are `null` entries (e.g. `icon_d2` ends
  ~+48–64 h). A single requested model outside its geographic coverage →
  HTTP 400 `{"error":true,"reason":"No data is available for this location"}`;
  invalid model ids → HTTP 400 with an "invalid String value" reason.
- Model ids verified working: `icon_d2`, `icon_eu`, `icon_global`,
  `ecmwf_ifs025`, `gfs_seamless`, `ukmo_global_deterministic_10km`,
  `meteoswiss_icon_ch1`, `meteoswiss_icon_ch2` (~1 km, Alps coverage — in
  range for the default Lucerne location). No warnings endpoint.

## Conventions

- **Git: NEVER `git push`** — the user pushes. Commit messages are Conventional
  Commits (commitlint-enforced).
- Versioning is release-please. Never edit `<Version>` in
  `src/Directory.Build.props` by hand.
- Central package management with transitive pinning: versions live only in
  `src/Directory.Packages.props`; add packages via `dotnet add package`, never
  edit csproj XML for versions.
- Tests: `Spec` suffix, `sealed` classes, `[Fact(Timeout = 5000)]`, BDD-style
  method names.
- C#: records for messages/DTOs, value objects in the domain, `sealed` by
  default, nullable enabled.

## Workflow

Changes go through OpenSpec: `/opsx:explore` to think → `/opsx:propose` to create
a change (proposal/design/specs/tasks) → `/opsx:apply` to implement → `/opsx:archive`.
Implementation is TDD; run `dotnet slopwatch` (local tool) after substantial code
changes.
