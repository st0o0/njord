## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: No disabled tests
Test methods in `Njord.Tests` and `Njord.Tests.Shared` SHALL NOT be disabled: no `Fact` or `Theory` attribute SHALL carry a non-empty `Skip` (or `SkipUnless`/`SkipWhen`), and no `Ignore` attribute SHALL be used. The check SHALL cover public and non-public methods of all types, so it holds independent of the file naming that slopwatch's disabled-test rule inspects.

#### Scenario: Skipped test
- **WHEN** a test method declares `[Fact(Skip = "...")]` or `[Theory(Skip = "...")]`
- **THEN** the architecture test run fails and names the declaring type and method

#### Scenario: Ignored test
- **WHEN** a test method or class carries an `Ignore` attribute
- **THEN** the architecture test run fails and names the declaring type and method

#### Scenario: No disabled tests in the current code
- **WHEN** the architecture tests run against the current test assemblies
- **THEN** they pass
